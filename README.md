# 3DDrugReceptor
3D models for teaching receptor ligand/agonist/antagonist binding.

These models were designed for teaching individuals with low or no vision about ligand (neurotransmitters, full and partial agonists, competitive and non-competitive antagonists) binding and activation/inactivation of cell receptors. These models are a companion to this video on mechanisms of drug action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msJTd1aj5Q4

Instructors are encouraged to utilize and revise these models as necessary for use in their own classrooms.

These models are presented in .stl format and are designed to be printed on any standard filament or resin 3D printer. Prints should require minimal/no supports on accurately calibrated and set up machines.

Receptor model is approximately 4cm in diameter and 5cm tall. Ligand models are approximately 3cm in diameter and 2cm tall. Non-competitive antagonist is approximately 1cm square at the base and 3cm tall.

Ligands (neurotransmitter, agonist, competitive antagonist) in Version 2022-07-14 will likely require some sanding/post-processing to accurately fit into the receptor.
