# 3DDrugReceptor
3D models for teaching receptor ligand/agonist/antagonist binding.

These models were designed for teaching individuals with low or no vision about ligand (neurotransmitters, full and partial agonists, competitive and non-competitive antagonists) binding and activation/inactivation of cell receptors. These models are a companion to this video on mechanisms of drug action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msJTd1aj5Q4

Instructors are encouraged to utilize and revise these models as necessary for use in their own classrooms (while following the CC BY-SA 4.0 license agreement indicated below).

NOTE: Models with braille writing are intended to be printed with high resolution at full-size (100% scale) only to ensure that braille can be read easily. Scaling these models will negatively affect the size and spacing of the braille dots, and low resolution printing can distort the dots, thereby eliminating any benefits obtained from having the braille writing. For low resolution or scaled prints, please use the standard, non-braille models.

These models are presented in .stl format and are designed to be printed on any standard filament or resin 3D printer. Prints should require minimal/no supports on accurately calibrated and set up machines. Models with braille writing should ideally be printed at a higher resolution to ensure the writing is legible.

REVISIONS:

Version 2022-11-16 Revisions:
- Receptor activation can now be determined by feel via extensions on the ligands which fit into the notches in the receptor. Full activation = 2 extensions; partial activation = 1 extension; no activation = no extensions.
- Ligands are now labelled: FA = full agonist; PA = partial agonist; CA = competitive antagonist; NCA = non-competitive antagonist. Ligands are also available with the same labels in braille.
- The active site on the receptor and the sides of the ligands are now slightly angled to improve fitment without the need for post-processing.
- Due to breakage of the ligand tabs on previous versions, the tabs have been replaced with an indent.


SIZING DETAILS:

- Version 10mm 2022-11-16 Sizing:
Receptor model is approximately 10cm in diameter and 7 cm tall. Ligand models are approximately 8cm in diameter and 2.5cm tall. Non-competitive antagonist is approximately 2cm square at the base and 5cm tall.

- Version 2022-07-14 Sizing:
Receptor model is approximately 4cm in diameter and 5cm tall. Ligand models are approximately 3cm in diameter and 2cm tall. Non-competitive antagonist is approximately 1cm square at the base and 3cm tall. Ligands (neurotransmitter, agonist, competitive antagonist) will likely require some sanding/post-processing to accurately fit into the receptor.
